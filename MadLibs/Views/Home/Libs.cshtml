<h1>Tale of Two Programmers</h1>
<p>Once upon a time, there were two @Model.Adjective1 programmers. Their names were @Model.ProperNoun1 and @Model.ProperNoun2. They were trying to build a program that would @Model.Verb1. But oh no! There was a @Model.Adjective2 mistake! Instead of @Model.Verb1, the program would @Model.Verb2 a @Model.Noun. </p>
<p>Instead of fixing it @Model.ProperNoun1 and @Model.ProperNoun2 decided the world would be a @Model.Adjective3 place if they left the program as is. They named the program @Model.ProperNoun3 and went down in history as the most @Model.Adjective4 developers in history. </p>
